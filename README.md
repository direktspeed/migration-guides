Migration Guides
A Collection of Migration Guides for React, Vue, jQuery, and DoneJS.

## Basic Facts
- The Browser DOM is extremely fast.
- There is a significant knowledge gap between those who create browsers and internet standards and so-called senior engineers.
- Fewer function calls and less frequent changes to abstractions over APIs designed to last, such as the Web API itself, lead to greater simplicity and maintainability.
- Modern browsers already offer a comprehensive set of functions that were previously provided by frameworks.
- The Mutation Observer API is not well documented in terms of its high-level functionality and how it fundamentally shifts web coding from reactive to imperative paradigms.

## Why This Guide?
Many beginners get lost when learning to code, often relying on frameworks that incur technical debt. They cannot judge the frameworks' implementation due to a lack of understanding. As one of the original developers of jQuery and many other frameworks, I aim to document a way out of dependency hell. This guide provides the standards for web development for 2030 and beyond, showing you how to adopt them incrementally today to be prepared for the future.

## Historical Fun Facts for Entertainment and Education
You might wonder why internet groups made certain decisions. The last 25 years of the internet have been a whirlwind. The number of coders has doubled every few years, but the number of senior developers has not scaled in the same way. Today, someone who can code a webpage might call themselves a senior developer simply because, within their group, they are relatively more experienced.

True senior developers are rare. While there are many experienced individuals, few can keep up with the rapid pace of change in technology.

## Conclusion
I have spent considerable time understanding why people argue as they do and how social dynamics influence these discussions. This set of guides aims to provide useful information for the future, ensuring that the knowledge is accessible and understandable.


### Browser Rendering Pipeline
Inital Parse Start => Head apply Head => Paint Head => Start Body parsing (here it can get wild when some Content Types come into consideration XHTML XML and so on we only care for html now)  => => Secund Iteration of the JS Stack first iteration of the Module Stack! => first chunk Mutation apply => first paint event aka DOMCOntent Loaded can race with Module Stack if it does not use top level await to block. 

Now we can Use Mutation Observer To Imperativ handle the Page and ServiceWorkers could even modify the Inital Load from now on for this Document that is also importent service-worker get registered for a scope but they get used by a HTML Document they get not used by other urls that you direct hit outside the scope the html document that does load them. the scope only defines the subset of the page requests that this service worker should handle so it is also consider able to have diffrent workers per page! not by path.
