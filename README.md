# migration-guides
A Collection of Migration Guides for React, Vue, and others like JQuery. DoneJS


## Basic Facts not Arrgueable
- The Browser DOM is Ultra Fast
- The knowledge gap between the once who create browsers and interntstandards and so called senior engineers is high!
- Less Function calls and less often changing abstractions over a API that is designed to last like the Web API it self leads to more simplicity so more maintainablity.
- Today browers got already a nice set of functiosn that before where supplyed by frameworks.
- The Mutation Observer API is not well documented in sense of what it real does on a highlevel and how it changes the while Pradigm of Web Coding from Reactive to Imperativ!

## Why?
Because today the most people are lost when they start to learn coding and they buy into technical dept of Frameworks that they do not can judge as they do not understand how the Frameworks them Self are Implemented as one of the Last People that even did create jQuery and most of the other Frameworks by them self i want to Document the way out of the dependency Hell so supply you the 2030+ Standarad for Web Development and show you how to incremental adopt it today so that your ready before 2030.

## Historical Funfacts for Entertainment and Education as you maybe ask your self why did the Internet Groups did what they did.
It was a ruff time the last 25 years of the Internet where Rocketing. Amount of Coders doubled every few years but Seniors did not Scale in the same fashion. 
Thats why today some one who can code a webpage calls him self senior because in his group of people he is maybe real the senior.

Real Seniors do not exist anymore there are old People but they do not come to the Same observations and conclusions because even passing at that speed is a lot of effort.

I often spend time to understand why people arrgument the way they do and how all that Social stuff works. Thats why now this guides come up as i know else no one will listen and understand but with this set of guides i can do somethign usefull for the future.
